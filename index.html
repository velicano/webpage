            <p>
                Our project is about developing a sustainable garden in our school. We aim to create a space where students can learn about horticulture, sustainability, and the importance of environmental stewardship. The project includes designing the garden layout, selecting appropriate plants, and creating a maintenance plan to ensure its longevity. We also plan to integrate educational workshops for students and the local community, focusing on topics such as composting, water conservation, and organic farming.
