            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>
                In the modern world, a large number of tasks are automated by different types of robots, of which mobile robots are a prominent subfield. These autonomous machines have mobility and are used in various fields such as entertainment, home appliances, military and medical sectors. These applications require mobile robots to perform complex tasks and navigate diverse environments. Our focus in this field is to optimize the hardware of existing mobile robots and increase the efficiency of their navigation algorithms so that they can work more effectively and reliably in their relevant applications.

            <h2>Multi-Map Navigation</h2>
            <p>
                During the model development phase, we developed a robust solution that allows robots to seamlessly switch between multiple maps. We provide precise and effective navigation by leveraging the capabilities of the Robot Operating System (ROS), LIDAR technology, SLAM Toolbox and Motion Base. ROS acts as the backbone by integrating various software tools and hardware components required for the robot to operate. LIDAR is used to collect detailed environmental data vital to detecting obstacles and ensuring safe navigation. This integration of advanced technologies forms the basis of a reliable and adaptable robotic navigation system. The SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) Toolbox plays a crucial role in our setup by creating and constantly updating maps while also localizing the robot within the maps. This dual functionality allows the robot to accurately understand its environment and maintain its position in complex environments. The SLAM Toolbox's ability to dynamically update maps ensures that the robot can adapt to changes in the environment, thus increasing its ability to navigate efficiently and accurately. Move Base complements the SLAM Toolbox by handling path planning and obstacle avoidance. Using real-time data from LIDAR, Move Base dynamically adapts paths, allowing the robot to reach specific points autonomously, even in complex and unpredictable environments. Move Base improves the robot's ability to navigate autonomously and respond to unpredictable obstacles by continuously adjusting routes based on the latest environmental data. This comprehensive setup not only facilitates precise navigation, but also allows the robot to perform tasks with a high degree of autonomy and reliability.

            <h2>Internal Robot Cable Arrangements</h2>
            <p>
                Initially, the cables inside mobile robots would get tangled in the wheels or drag on the ground while they were in motion. The team then solved this problem by meticulously arranging the cables so that they stayed securely in place, significantly increasing the efficiency and lifespan of the robot.

            <h2>User Interface, Arduino</h2>
            <p>
                Previously, there was no way to check remaining battery life or manage Wi-Fi connections for the mobile robot, leading to unexpected power losses and connectivity issues. To solve this problem, the team developed and deployed an Arduino tool equipped with a small screen that provides quick on-site control. This tool not only monitors the remaining battery but also displays the current Wi-Fi network, showing current networks that can be accessed and allowing users to switch between networks seamlessly. This development significantly increases the reliability and operational efficiency of the robot.

            <h2>New Power Switch</h2>
            <p>
                Some wiring was modified to add a new power switch to the mobile robot that allows the motors to be turned on and off independently of the main power source. Before this change, when the motors had to be turned off and on, the entire robot had to be shut down. Now, with this switch, only the motors are cut off and the process becomes much more efficient. This improvement enables smoother operation and maintenance because the motors required to control the wheels can be managed without disrupting the overall functionality of the robot.
